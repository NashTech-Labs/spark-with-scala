Spark with Scala

In this repo I have analysed a movie and user csv files through spark.

**Movie Details Schema:**
>>"MID Int, Movie_Name String, Movie_Type String"

**User Details Schema:**
>>"UserID Int, MID Int, rating Int, timestamp String"

**Analyzed Output**
1. CountMovieType
2. CountByRating
3. CountTopFiveRatingMovies
